# Frontend Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Location Tracker frontend is a React TypeScript application that provides real-time GPS tracking, trip management, and historical data visualization. The application has been modularized into a clean, maintainable architecture following React best practices.

## Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with well-defined interfaces
- **Reusability**: Modular components and hooks that can be reused
- **Testability**: Individual modules can be unit tested independently
- **Performance**: Optimized state management and API caching

## Core Modules

### 1. Types (`/types`)

Centralized TypeScript definitions providing type safety across the application.

#### `api.ts`
- API response interfaces
- HTTP request/response type definitions
- Error handling types

#### `location.ts`
- Core location data types (`Location`, `SessionInfo`)
- Trip and session interfaces (`DriversLogEntry`, `PastSession`)
- Geographic data types

#### `ui.ts`
- UI-specific types (form states, editing modes)
- Component prop interfaces

### 2. Services (`/services`)

Business logic layer handling all API communications and data processing.

#### `api.ts`
- Centralized API endpoint configuration
- Constants and configuration values

#### `locationService.ts`
- Real-time location fetching
- Historical location data retrieval
- Session data processing and analytics
- Vehicle management

#### `geocodingService.ts`
- Address reverse geocoding (coordinates â†’ address)
- Address forward geocoding (address â†’ coordinates)
- Address validation and caching
- Geographic coordinate validation

#### `driversLogService.ts`
- Trip saving and management
- Driver's log CRUD operations
- Session conflict detection
- Route data retrieval

#### `sessionsService.ts`
- Past session scanning and loading
- Session metadata management
- Historical data analysis

#### `utilityService.ts`
- Distance calculations (Haversine formula)
- Date/time formatting utilities
- Common helper functions

### 3. Components (`/components`)

Reusable UI components following React best practices.

#### Navigation Components (`/navigation`)
- **`NavigationHeader`**: Main app header with tabs and vehicle selector
- **`NavigationTabs`**: View mode switching (Trips/Live/Timeline)
- **`VehicleSelector`**: Vehicle selection dropdown with refresh

#### Trip Components (`/trips`)
- **`TripsOverviewPanel`**: Grid display of saved trips
- **`TripCard`**: Individual trip display with statistics and actions

#### Form Components (`/forms`)
- **`LogForm`**: Trip saving form with purpose and notes

### 4. Custom Hooks (`/hooks`)

State management hooks encapsulating related logic and state.

#### `useAddressManagement`
- Address caching and validation
- Geocoding operations
- Address editing workflow
- Cache management for performance

#### `useVehicleManagement`
- Vehicle selection state
- Vehicle list fetching and management
- Vehicle-specific operations

#### `useLocationData`
- Current location state
- Historical location data
- Live tracking mode
- Map state management

#### `useUIState`

## Data Flow

### 1. Location Data Flow
```
User Action â†’ Hook (useLocationData) â†’ Service (locationService) â†’ API â†’ State Update â†’ UI Render
```

### 2. Trip Management Flow
```
User Creates Trip â†’ useDriversLogs â†’ driversLogService â†’ API â†’ State Update â†’ Refresh UI
```

### 3. Address Management Flow
```
Address Edit â†’ useAddressManagement â†’ geocodingService â†’ Validation â†’ Cache Update â†’ UI Update
```

## State Management Strategy

### Local Component State
- UI-specific temporary state (form inputs, loading states)
- Component-level interactions

### Custom Hooks State
- Feature-specific state groupings
- Related state and logic encapsulation
- Cross-component state sharing

### Caching Strategy
- **Address Cache**: Map-based caching for geocoded addresses
- **Service Layer**: Optimized API calls with error handling
- **State Persistence**: Hooks maintain state consistency

## API Integration

### Endpoints
- **Location API**: Real-time GPS data
- **History API**: Historical location data
- **Drivers Log API**: Trip management
- **Geocoding API**: Address services
- **Sessions API**: Past session scanning
- **Vehicles API**: Vehicle management

### Error Handling
- Centralized error handling in services
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for failed requests

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching
- Address geocoding cache to prevent redundant API calls
- Map rendering optimization with key-based re-rendering

### State Management
- useCallback and useMemo for expensive operations
- Efficient state updates with minimal re-renders
- Lazy loading for heavy components

### Bundle Optimization
- Modular imports to enable tree shaking
- Component code splitting potential
- Optimized dependency management

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Services**: API integration and business logic
- **Hooks**: State management and side effects
- **Components**: UI rendering and interactions
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and calculations

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end user workflows
- API integration testing
- Cross-component interactions
